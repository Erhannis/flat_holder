Sortof a shelf/holder for flat things.  Pushpin the short ones to the wall pointing up, and the long ones to the wall pointing down, then you can stick a flat thing (keyboard, drawing tablet, maybe a plate or st) up into the long ones and set it into the short ones so it stays.

Run get_deps.sh to pull dependencies into a linked folder in your home directory.
